# Verilog-DE10-Elevator
Elevator display for the DE-10 board in Verilog.

# Usage
This Verilog program displays an elevator on a DE10 board's seven-segment displays. The desired floor is inputted in binary format using slide switches and the elevator begins to "move" to that floor upon a button press. The SSDs display the elevator doors open/closed when the elevator is stationary/moving, respectively, as well as the target floor and current floor.

The project uses no external hardware other than a DE10 board, only utilizing built-in timers, switches, buttons, and displays on the board.
